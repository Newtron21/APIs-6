# APis-6
‚Äã
## Description

- My motivation was AS A traveler, I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
- I built this project so you could call upon web apis to see weather for different cities
- The problem it solves is to be able to see what weather it is in multiple cities to plan accordingly
- I learned how to implement APIs and fetch calls to be able to call in data from different apis and use it on different webpages.
